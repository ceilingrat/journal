**Hack Fukuoka** is approaching quickly and I need an idea for a talk.  Today I've begun working on a project to implement an idea for improving the tutorial experience.

In future posts I will elaborate on what I want to accomplish.  First, I will journal what actions I'm taking.

So far, I have just created a repo on GitHub.  Next I will create a new **repl** to use as a dev environment.

This present method I'm using for the initial steps of the repo is a bit janky and I recognize that.  This is a big motiviation for me to journal all my steps in great detail.  Later, I'd like to revisit this and streamline the initialization process a lot.

It would be nice to have a really clean commit history in **git**.   I think it is possible to go back and prune the git history (and maybe for this repo I will), but I'd rather establish a cleaner method that requires less mopping up.



Here's a quick look at what's done and what needs to be done:

* [x] repo created
* [ ] repl created
* [ ] add `run.sh`
* [ ] add & modify `.replit`
* [ ] modify `.gitignore`
* [ ] add `docs` directory
* [ ] install `github-pages` gem
* [ ] modify `run.sh`
* [ ] install **reveal.js**
* [ ] modify `README.md`
* [ ] configure GitHub Pages

For reference, the `journal` **repl** is a great example to look at for `github-pages` configuration.

Since I have `journal` open to write this, this is very convenient.
