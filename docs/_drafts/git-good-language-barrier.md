Recently I went to the Engineer Cafe Discord server.  I wanted to familiarize myself with it for the purpose of socializing and encouraging people to come to the **Git Good** event.

It was harder than I thought.  But I think there might be some lessons in here that I can use for the event.

## Language

The Discord is primarily in Japanese and I just don't speak it, and I absolutely can't read it.  That means I can't just idly browse it without a lot of work.

## Barriers to Translation

### Discord

If I want to translate anything on the Discord site, at minimum I need a Chrome extension.

The default behavior of Discord **disables right-clicking** and **disables highlighting** some important text.

Luckily I found 1 extension that enables both of these.

### Repeated trips to Google ### Without communication, is this really a "community"translate

I'm happy that Google Chrome will translate from the right-click context menu, but the nature of how Discord refreshes the page requires that I trigger the translate action often.

This makes it impossible to browse without intention.

### machine translation quality

Simply put, machine translation is only an approximation.  

## Some Impressions

### Can foreigners use this?

Without knowledge of a Chrome extension to enable right-click, can any non-Japanese speakers even get started?

### DO foreigners use this?

Forgetting the ability for a moment, are non-Japanese people actually making the effort to use Discord?

### Is communication happening between the Japanese and the non-Japanese?

If not on Discord, then how?

If communication isn't happening, then I question whether or not it is appropriate to use the term "community" to refer to all the people associated with the cafe.

### Is this intimidating enough to halt some people from participating?
