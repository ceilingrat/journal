In pursuit of increased attendance for the **Git Good** event, I'd like to put forth some ideas for topics that could make for posts to social media and/or the Discord.

## Ad or Discussion?

Bulletins like *"There's a Git event coming up next week, sign up today!"* are definitely useful and have their place, but truthfully there's not a lot of opportunities to interact with something like that.   Either follow the call-to-action or don't.

I'd like to balance out those ads with something a bit more "discuss-able", maybe centered around a blog post or a short video.

## Prerequisites

There's an opportunity to simultaneously advertise the **Git Good** event and also explain the prerequisites while checking that attendees are prepared and offer support if they have trouble.

What prerequisites?

* **GitHub account**  
This is going to be a must-have
* **Repl.it account**  
If the GitHub account exists, this can be created with just one or two clicks.  
* **can run Repl.it**  
Repl.it is supported on a lot of devices, but it would be good to check their device in advance.
* **can run Jitsi Meet**  
Similarly, Jitsi Meet has support for many devices, but some devices may require a standalone app for the call.  
It is worth verifying that users can operate the Jitsi Meet app to ensure a smooth meeting.

For any of these prerequisites, there exist opportunities to do some or all of the following:

* create instructions  
(written or video)
* let users try it out  
(such as a test Jitsi meeting)
* offer support

## Why Git?

This is a topic I've really wanted to emphasize in the event itself since we first started discussing the event.

However, I believe that the alloted 2 hours will go by really fast and there's just so many things to discuss.

It would make a lot of sense to take much (or all) of the things I want to say to discuss **"why use git"** and turn this into promotional material.

It seems really logical that after I argue the case *"you should be using git"*, I should follow the call-to-action *"join our upcoming event to get started"*

## Language Barrier

So as I understand it, there have been some Japanese students who are intimidated by the idea of a bilingual event.

I understand this intimidation, and I feel it pretty strongly myself.  Even when I go into the Engineer Cafe in person or when I go onto the Discord, the language barrier intimidates me.

I'd like to somehow address the reality of this, and the reality of the tension of feeling pressured to be fluent in another language.

Stopping short of saying "don't bother to learn another language", I would like to find a way to express this idea: 

"It's **not necessary** to first become fluent in a new language, and *then* start having interactions with people who speak that language. In fact, there are a lot of ways to have interactions, no matter where your language abilities are today."

I'm a little bit unsure about how best to have this conversation, especially because I think it requires some translation.

I'd love to make something resembling a podcast recording, but I must keep in mind that the execution may require some planning. And I don't know whether or not the planning and effort required are realistic or not.

I hope that I can find *some way* to communicate to others that I really understand the tension surrounding a foreign language.
