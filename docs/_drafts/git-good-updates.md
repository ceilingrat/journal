Over the weekend I did some work on the **Git Good** project, so this is a quick run-down of what I did.

<div style="float: right; margin-left: 1em;">
  <script id="asciicast-CL2YMXsxjjtWQiy3HYVSMHw4u" src="https://asciinema.org/a/CL2YMXsxjjtWQiy3HYVSMHw4u.js" async></script>
</div>

## Completed Tasks

- [x] set up a chat channel [over at Gitter](https://gitter.im/ceilingrat/git-good)
- [x] merged branch `feature-branch` into branch `dev`
- [x] recorded this merge using asciicinema *(embedded to the right)*
- [x] embedded Excalidraw into [the sandbox](https://git-good.ceilingrat.repl.co/stream.html) I've been using for experiments relating to a participant UI containing multiple embedded frames.

## Next Tasks

The next two areas where I want to turn my attention:

- [ ] list out all the many things that need to be done
- [ ] spend some time working with **reveal.js** for the slide deck of the presentation
