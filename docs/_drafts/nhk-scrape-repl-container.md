I've just created a new **GitHub** repository as well as a **Replit** container to use for this project.

It is important to point out that these are both *publicly visible*, but to make edits you will need to request access.  However, you can always make your own fork.

## GitHub repo

https://github.com/ceilingrat/news-scrape/

### branches

This repo presently has two branches, `main` and `dev`.   
`dev` is where I am pushing commits as I do work, and `main` is where I will push commits that I want public.

## Replit container

### embed

As teased earlier, this container can be embedded:
