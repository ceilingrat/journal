# Slides Upgrade
## First steps

This will be an introduction to a new project to transition to a new platform for slides.

### Goals

At the core will be technical goals, but as always documentation and communication of the project is vitally important as well.

The technical goals are:
* transition from **Google Slides** to **Reveal.js**
* develop workflow to **scrape text** from source materials (PDF) and **generate** slides using a **template**

Communication goals:
* a project development site to complement the journal entries
* an end product that can be distributed 

### Next Actions

* [ ] establish a project tracker 
    * [ ] root page with overview, links
    * [ ] individual node pages as necessary
* [ ] document processes
    * [ ] current process with Google Sheets template
    * [ ] past experiments with automation
    * [ ] desired future process
* [ ] document dev sessions (to journal)  
*example: running tests with `pdftohtml`*
