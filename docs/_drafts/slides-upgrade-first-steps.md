# Slides Upgrade
## First steps

This will be an introduction to a new project to transition to a new platform for slides.

### Goals

At the core will be technical goals, but as always documentation and communication of the project is vitally important as well.

The technical goals are:
* transition from **Google Slides** to **Reveal.js**
* develop workflow to **scrape text** from source materials (PDF) and **generate** slides using a **template**
