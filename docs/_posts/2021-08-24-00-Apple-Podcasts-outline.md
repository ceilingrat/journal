I don't plan to make updates to this post.   
I might make a dedicated project page later.  If I do, that will receive updates.

So this will be a sort of throw-away back-of-the-napkin summary of what work needs to be done.

- [x] console-based prototype
  - [x] bash script
  - [x] demo video using asciinema
- [ ] publish
  - [ ] code
    - [ ] github repo
  - [ ] docs
    - [ ] github pages using same repo
    - [ ] README in root level of same repo with links to github pages
  - [ ] promos
    - [ ] presentation / slideshow
    - [ ] video(s)
    - [ ] social media
- [ ] support
  - [ ] gitter
- [ ] refactor
  - [ ] individual script files for XML, JSON, AWK
  - [ ] more exhaustive scraping (any properties)
  - [ ] RSS output
  - [ ] other output? (e.g. M3U for VLC?)
