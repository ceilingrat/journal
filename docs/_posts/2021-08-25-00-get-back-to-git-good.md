The **Apple Podcasts scraper** project has been good for me in a lot of ways.  Besides the obvious cleanse of my palate, it motivated me to tackle some challenges related to publishing projects, particularly with GitHub Pages.

I haven't finished publishing this project, but my schedule requires me to put this project on hold and return to it later.

However, I feel some sense of accomplishment knowing that I'm going back into the **Git Good** project with a better of foundation of Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

Even this journal!  I think this will be incredibly useful for journaling my development of **Git Good**, but I think the **Apple Podcasts** project motivated me to set this up.
