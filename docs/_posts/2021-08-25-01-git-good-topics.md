There's a lot of work to be done for the **Git Good** event, but at this point one of the most important tasks is to clarify which topics *do* and *do not* belong in this event.

## vocabulary

My creative process is informed by vocabulary, particularly concepts like *nouns*, *verbs*, etc.

However, there are other important concepts, such as *roles* of users.

## roles

I want to emphasize the role of *creators* and give minimal attention to all other roles.

| role |   |
| --- | --- |
| creator | ✅ |
| proofreader, editor | ✅ |
| designer | ✅ |
| *(anyone making edits to content)* | ✅ |
| project manager | ❎ |
| system administrator | ❎ |
| *(anyone managing the team<br> or the git repository)* | ❎ |

For greater clarification, the following topics are absolutely out of scope for this event:

| topics |   |
| --- | --- |
| cosmetic work to the repository<br> *example: **rebasing** * | ❎ |
| integrating git into a system-wide publishing workflow <br>*example: **hooks** * | ❎ |

The topics below are fair game, but I cannot guarantee that there will be time for all these topics.

| topics |   |
| --- | --- |
| user-level scripts involving git<br> *example: **triggering several git user actions with one script** * | ✅ |
| some best practices<br> (not exhaustive list, but the most important ones)<br> *examples: **concise commit descriptions**,<br> **not too many changes in a single commit** * | ✅ |

So at this point we've defined **who** our audience is (which roles), now let's investigate **what** things they need to be aware of and **how** they act upon those things.

## nouns and verbs
